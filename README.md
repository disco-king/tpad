# tpad

tpad.sh is a tiny bash script that can enable or disable the touchpad on a Linux laptop. It uses xinput, so that is necessary for the script to work.

The repo also contains an installation script that copies tpad.sh to a desired location and adds an alias "tpad" to ~/.bash_aliases config file (creating the file if necessary)
